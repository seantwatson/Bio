# Bio

Hey all, welcome to my GitHub! My name is Sean, and I'm a professional Data Analyst. I have a Bachelor's in Business Analytics and Economics, and my work is more adjacent to cost analysis, but my main passion is sports data analytics.

I sort of fell into my interest with Data Science on accident. I happened to be entering the econometrics courses in my degree at the same time that I fell into my full on obsession with soccer. I had previously been interested in pursuing math, but something about statistics and the practical applications of statistical methods across a huge range of domains really spoke to me. The idea of using math and statistics to sports as a math problem was fascinating to me, and I began to write for a fan site for my soccer team (Liverpool FC) with a slant of data journalism.

From there I decided to concentrate in Business Analytics as well, which lead me down the path I'm now currently on. After graduating I decided to pursue a Masters in Data Science with a concentration in healthcare analytics, another area I'm passionate about.

I aim to use this github as a repository for all of my documented data science projects, for school and personal pet projects, in the hopes of collaborating with like-minded indviduals and improving my skills.
